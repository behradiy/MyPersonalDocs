Most of my knowledge is based on asking and learning from professionals, so i see knowledge sharing a duty now.
long story short:
In this repo i'm sharing what i've learned and found usefull throughout my journey of learning.

Almost everything has this structure :
- getting your hands on installing that tech
- tricks about the tech that i found intresting

feel free to suggest changes in anything, anywhere.
good luck
