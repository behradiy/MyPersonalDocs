Most of my knowledge is based on asking and learning from others, so i consider knowledge-sharing as my duty.
long story short:
I created this repo to share with you what i've found usefull throughout my own journey of learning.

Almost every file has this structure :
- getting your hands on installing/using that tech
- tricks about it that makes your lifes easier 

feel free to suggest changes in anything, anywhere.
